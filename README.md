# Physics Simulation
This project is part of the Physics Simulation module assignment.

## Description
This project aims to create a physics middleware based on PhysX 3.4.2. The middleware will facilitate the recording of simulation demos, providing a robust platform for simulating various physical interactions.

The project also focuses on integrating physics seamlessly into the game engine with minimal dependencies.

Additionally, this project will develop a small game engine built upon the original GLUT framework. The game engine will be designed to support basic gaming functionalities and provide a foundation for creating interactive experiences.

## Features
